* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Chrome extension: EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=es)
  * Note: activate the extension in ingognito mode, in the extension settigs 

## Installation

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/darideveloper/europeanstartups_scraper.git
   ```
2. Install python packages (opening a terminal in the project folder)
   ```sh
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
   ```

# Settings

## Activate extension in incognito mode

2. Click in the `Details` button of the `EditThisCookie` extension
3. Activate the `Allow in incognito` option

## Cookies file

The bot need the user cookies to avoid the login in the page. The cookies are saved in the `cookies.json` file (create file if not exist).
For save the cookies, do the following steps (with the chrome extension [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=es) already installed):

1. Open the file `cookies.txt` in the project folder
2. Paste the cookies
8. Save file

note: be sure of not close the session in the browser, if you close the session the cookies will be lost. Intead of that, close incognito window and open a new one if you need another user.

## Proxies file

The bot will use proxies to avoid the instagram ban. The proxies are saved in the `proxies.json` (create file if not exist) file. The bot will use a random proxy for each request.

Proxies format:
```json
[
    {
        "user": "username",
        "password": "mypass",
        "host": "123.123.123.123",
        "ip": "1234"
    },
    {
        "user": "username2",
        "password": "mypass",
        "host": "123.123.123.234",
        "ip": "2345"
    }
]
```

## Env file

The `.env` (create file if not exist) file is used to save the settings of the bot. The file must be created in the project folder.

Sample file:
```bash
target_users = elonmusk,freddiervega
max_follow = 20
```

### target_users

List of users (separated by comma) that the bot will use to get the followers and last post comments and likes.

### max_follow

Total number of max number of users to follow from ALL target

## Multiple bots

For run multiple bots (on windows) fo the following steps:

1. Copy the project folder as many times as bots you want to run
2. Setup in each bot: cookies, proxies and env file
3. Create a file `run.bat` with the following content:
```bat
start cmd /k "python {project-folder-bot-1}\runs\autorun.py"
start cmd /k "python {project-folder-bot-1}\runs\autorun.py"
```
